#### Describe some of the disadvantages of using a style guide and the issues a team may run into as they develop and implement one.

# Disadvantages of Developing and Using Style Guides

Despite all the advantages of having a Style Guide, teams can run into several serious issues if it is not implemented carefully.

## Enterprise Actors

In an enterprise environment, there are some actors involved in making the decission of creating and mantain an Style Guide:

- **Developers:** they are responsible for the application code.
- **Project Managers:** they ensure projects are delivered on time and correctly.
- **Financier**: responsible for the activity profitability.

All of them must be happy with the implentation and maintenance of the style guide or it will be thrown away after a short time.

## Developers POV

Developers love coding. Having a style guide full of reusable resources which makes coding easier sounds like a developer heaven. Sadly, an style guide is such a kind of documentation, and developers hate writing and mantaining documentation. If creating and mantaining the guide becomes too tedious and consumes a large part of the developers time, they will rapidly feel demotivated; and you don't want to have demotivated developers in your team. Moreover, when deadlines are near, they will refuse to update the guide arguing that they only have time for the production code. This will lead to an outdated guide, which can be worst than having no guide at all.

## Project Managers POV

On the other hand, project managers usually like documentation, but the kind of documentation they like is customer oriented, such as *Users's Manual*. They are usually reluctant to invest resources on creating something that apparently does not increment the final product value or quality.

In addition, project managers, specially when immersed into big project, only care about the current project. They won't delay the current project delivery time implementing a tool for future projects. They think if the current project is not delivered on time and correctly, there will be no more projects for him in the company.

## Financier POV

Financier point of view is similar to the project manager one. The only change is the financier works with financial periods instead of projects. He won't accept the investment if he can't justify such a high expense in the current financial period.

## Style Guide Key to Success

The success of an style guide depends on finding a balanced point between the costs and the benefits of creating and mantaining it. Communitating its benefits well to the team members or to other departments is also key to keep a high confidence in the guide resources investment.
